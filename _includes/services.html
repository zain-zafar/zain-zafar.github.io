					can be generally enveloped by these. The completion of several complex assignments with peers and without in 
					limited time has led to growth in these areas to the point where I am supremely confident in 
					my abilities.</p>

					Whether it is Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or even Environmental Science, I

                    <p class="text-muted">During my second year of University, I used SQL to work with databases of several 
					thousand rows in size. The manipulation of these databases required great attention to syntax
					leading to the development of strong observation skills. Alongside SQL, the use of Python, Java, 
					and HTML has led to the development of strong programming skills.</p>
