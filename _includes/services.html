                    <h3>Solid Time Management & Problem Solving Ability</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">All of my university experience thus far
					revolves around time management and problem solving. The completion of several complex assignments with 
					and without peers, given limited time has led to growth in these areas to the point where I am supremely 
					confident in my abilities.</p>

                    <h3>Eager to Learn & Taking Initiative In order to Achieve Success</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted"> In school I am eager to learn, whether it is Computer Science, Mathematics, 
					Statistics, or even Environmental Science, I have never failed to take the initiative to LEARN 
					and APPLY what I have learned. Likewise, outside of school I have done the same, one such example is 
					this very website.</p>

                    <h3>Strong Programming & Data Observation skills</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">During my second year of University, I used SQL to work with databases of several 
					thousand rows in size. The manipulation of these databases required keen attention to syntax
					leading to the development of strong observation skills. Alongside SQL, the use of Python, Java, 
					and HTML has led to the development of strong programming skills.</p>

                    <h3>Applications of My Interests</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">I am a big fan of "experimenting" with android phones. Some things I have
					achieved is the: rooting, flashing of custom roms, flashing of custom recoveries, and 
					the repairing of bootloops in specific android devices. I have used applications such as Odin, ADB, 
					and I have made my own USB fans using PC fans (a bit of engineering).
